        <h6 class="text-info">Data Recovery and Insurance</h6>
        Un-bootable desktops, laptops & servers<br>
        • Crashed Raid volumes on servers<br>
        • Virus infected operating systems<br>
        • Drives damaged by power surges<br>

        • PC data recovery - Blue-screen of death<br>
        • Deleted files, folders and databases<br>
        • Drives that do not spin up.<br><br>
        With Advance in computing and mass storage, and increase in data loss, CBM is specialized in the field of Recovery and Insurance of computerised Data and Computer Hard-Disk Repair, with a proven 98% data recovery track record for  more than 14 years. CBM has recovered lost data from DOS, Windows, LAN and other operating systems, and also from various media Hard Disks, CDs, Zip cartridges and floppies.<br>
        Most companies have a Data Loss Prevention System in place, which typically consists of<br>
        - Periodic Back-ups, <br>
        - Communication Fire-walls, UPS systems, Anti-Virus, Multiple data copies etc.,<br>
        Inspite of all this data is lost due to negligence, wrong command, viruses etc. thus none of the above is 100% safe.<br>
        Data recovery is ususally quite costly and finding a right person/company who would give accurate data in  minimum time is a myth. so we religously believe "PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE". The objective of this proposal is not Post-mishap data recovery, but Pre-mishap Data Insurance , which we have recently launched. <br>
        In this service, pay once a nominal fee in advance per hard disk, recovering it free in the event of a mishap (or on event of  data loss)
